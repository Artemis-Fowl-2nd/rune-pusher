# Overview

Rune Pusher is a simple block pushing puzzle game, with cute interactable NPC’s describing the world our game is set in, to escape the maze constructed to trap you and your fellow Daemons from escaping. However, you are unexpectedly and magically imbued with the power to push the blocks embedded with magical runes. Escape the maze and free your fellow Daemons.

# Development Environment

Rune Pusher was developed in Godot 4, with the art made in Aseprite.

Our global save system was made with the godot plugin “sqlite,” which interacts with firebase to save the data of the level.
